# Reference Genomes
<html><div style='float:left'></div><hr color='#EB811B' size=1px width=720px></html> 

---
## Are there we there yet?

- The human genome isnt complete! 
- In fact, most model organisms's reference genomes are being regularly updated.
- Reference genomes consist of mixture of known chromosomes and unplaced contigs called a  **Genome Reference Assembly**.
- Major revisions to assembies result in change of co-ordinates.
- Requires conversion between revisions.
- The latest genome assembly for humans is GRCh38.
- Patches add information to the assembly without disrupting the chromosome coordinates . i.e GRCh38.p3

---
## Genome Reference Consortium.

- GRC is collaboration of institutes which curate and maintain the reference genomes for 3 model organims.
    - Human - GRCh38.p3
    - Mouse - GRCm38.p3
    - Zebrafish - GRCz10
- Other model organisms are maintained separately.
    - Drosophila - Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project, BDGP36

---
## Why do we need to know about reference genomes
- Allows for genes and genomic features to be evaluated in their linear genomic context.
    - Gene A is close to Gene B
    - Gene A and Gene B are within feature C.
- Can be used to align shallow targeted high-thoughput sequencing to a pre-built map of an organisms genome.

## Aligning to a reference genomes

---
## A reference genome

- A reference genome is a collection of contigs.
- A contig is a stretch of DNA sequence encoded as A,G,C,T,N.
- Typically comes in FASTA format.
    - ">" line contains information on contig
    - Lines following contain contig sequence

# Summarised Genomic Features formats.
<html><div style='float:left'></div><hr color='#EB811B' size=1px width=720px></html> 

---
## Summarised Genomic Features formats
- Post alignment, sequences reads are typically summarised into scores over/within genomic intervals.
    - BED - Genomic intervals and information.
    - Wiggle/BedGraph - Genomic intervals and scores.
    - GFF - Genomic annotation with information and scores

---
## Summarising in genomic intervals.

** BED format (BED) **

<div align="center">
<img src="imgs/BED3.png" alt="igv" height="200" width="400">
</div>

- Simple format
- 3 tab separated columns
- Chromsome, start, end

## Genomic Variants
- Variant Call Format (VCF)
- Mutation Annotation Format (MAF)

---
## Variant Call Format
Variant Call Format ([VCF](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.2.pdf)) is a text file format (most likely stored in a compressed manner). It contains 

- meta-information lines
- a header line
- data lines each containing information about a position in the genome 

***The format also has the ability to contain genotype information on samples for each position***.

---
## VCF Structure

</div>

---

## Mutation Annotation Format (MAF)
Mutation Annotation Format ([MAF](https://docs.gdc.cancer.gov/Data/File_Formats/MAF_Format/)) is a tab-delimited text file with aggregated **mutation information** from VCF files.

# Genomic Files for computing .
<html><div style='float:left'></div><hr color='#EB811B' size=1px width=720px></html> 

---
## bigWig, bigBED and TABIX

- Many programs and browsers deal better with compressed, indexed versions of genomic files
    - SAM -> BAM (.bam and index file of .bai)
    - Wiggle and bedGraph -> bigWig (.bw/.bigWig)
    - BED -> bigBed (.bb)
    - BED, VCF and GFF -> (.gz and index file of .tbi)
